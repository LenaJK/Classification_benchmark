Embedding protein sequences and testing embedding

Routine that embeds proteins (amino acid sequences from the PFAM dataset) using pre-trained language models (word2vec and doc2vec) and then looking at how well PFAM domain families are resolved in that embedding space using different similarity/clustering techniques (kNN, kmeans).
